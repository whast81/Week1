### Level 3 Heading

Wendy Hastick

This is a **paragraph**. A paragraph can be **long** or *short*. It is entirely up to us.

### We can put headings anywhere

In between paragraphs is a good spot for headings.

> Worker bees can leave.  
> Even drones can fly away.  
> The queen Is there slave.  

Quotes are cool.
