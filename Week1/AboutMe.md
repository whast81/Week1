### I would like to specialize in extracting data from databases. I am somewhat familiar with regex and tried to play around with it myself. It is a very unique specialty as well as R. I enjoy research and analytics from a technical aspect. I do enjoy learning how to become a software developer. It is a lot of fun being a part of a structured environment each day. I know post graduation I will be fully equipped as a entry level developer. I will be able to continuously grow in this specialized field. Also, it will allow me to contribute in this far advancing world in technology.
